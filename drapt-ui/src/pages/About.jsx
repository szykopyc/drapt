                <p>Drapt is a modular portfolio analytics platform for portfolio risk and performance analysis - built for clarity, speed, and most importantly to educate.</p>
                <p>Empowering Portfolio Managers and Analysts alike, it demystifies quantitative portfolio analysis in an intuitive way, making it accessible for all levels of technical proficiency, from students who have never heard of Python to seasoned quants.</p>
                <p>Powered by high-performance servers and optimised computation pipelines, Drapt makes it easier than ever to understand a portfolio's current position amidst the inherent chaos of financial markets.</p>

                <p>Drapt began its story as DRAP-T, an acronym for <i>Dynamic Risk Analysis and Performance Tool</i>, in November 2024.</p>
                <p>The inspiration for starting the project was my desire to incorporate quantitative risk analytics into the NEFS Investment Fund, as around 1 month into being an analyst I realised that The Fund relied on qualitative risk analysis.</p>
                <p>Until the revamp, Drapt was being developed in a very inefficient manner, with the following tech stack:</p>

                <p>This was the final version before the current revamp. It helped take my team in the WBSS Investment Challenge 2024/2025 to the finals, it was really quite fantastic.</p>
                <p>Fixes were made, styles were changed, and the platform became a whole lot more functional. I mean, <i>I would hope so</i>, it took 3 months.</p>
                <p>Additionally, DRAP-T was renamed to <b>Drapt Analytics</b>, to reflect the clean interface and professional usability of the platform.</p>
                <p>From a high level, improvements and feature changes included:</p>
                <CustomUL>
                    <CustomLI>Changed the style, from that odd green and gray to a more professional blue on white.</CustomLI>
                    <CustomLI>Fixed cumulative returns (using log returns now instead of percentage returns).</CustomLI>
                    <CustomLI>Added rolling volatility analysis (Figure 2), this really was a great feature.</CustomLI>
                    <CustomLI>Improved the asset correlation matrix (Figure 3).</CustomLI>

                <p>At the end of May 2025, I decided to revamp Drapt Analytics, rebuilding it using a modern React frontend (using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI), as well as upgrading the backend.</p>
                <p>As well as this, there was a (yet another) name change, with the platform now called <b>Drapt</b>.</p>
                <p>Drapt is still in motion, slowly accelerating, but it's already become something far greater than I imagined when I started. Thanks for reading - and welcome aboard.</p>
